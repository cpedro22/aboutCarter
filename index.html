    <p>Hello! I'm Carter, a student at BYU with a passion for growing plants. I started my journey at BYU in 2021 when I applied and got in for summer semester. Since then, I've been on a mission in Arizona and I am now back at BYU.</p>
    
    <p>My values are centered around Jesus Christ, and I believe in striving to be like Christ.</p>
